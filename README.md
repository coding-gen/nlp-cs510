Code for our final project for the Natural Language Processing course taught in Fall of 2022 at Portland State University.

To use on a VM, run the commands in machine_set_up.txt. 
To train the model use punderful-data-and-training.py
To run a pretrained model, additional code is present in punderful_project which is included in both .py and .ipynb formats.

The 5th epoch of the pretrained T5 model will be posted soon.
