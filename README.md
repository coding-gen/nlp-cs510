Code for our final project for the Natural Language Processing course taught in Fall of 2022 at Portland State University.

To use on a VM, run the commands in machine_set_up.txt. 
Then run AmbiExPUNations.py
This currently runs through processing the data and training the T5.

The 5th epoch of the pretrained T5 model will be posted soon.
